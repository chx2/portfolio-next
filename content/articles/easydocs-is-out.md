# What is EasyDocs?

[EasyDocs](https://github.com/chx2/EasyDocs) allows for you to create & edit user documentation with a built-in dashboard centered around the organization of documentation under various user defined topics.

No database is required to run EasyDocs. A full-installation process will take less than five minutes and will have you easily spinning up documentation in no time!

## Features

There are numerous features within EasyDocs that make the creation of user documentation easy:

- Database(less): One of the main features of EasyDocs is there is no need for a database of any sort.
- Easy Configuration: Much of EasyDocs can be modified from one config file. This file has it’s definitions layed out in very easy-to-understand terms, meaning someone without programming knowledge would be able to know what they’re modifying.
- ADA Compliancy: Documentation generated for the user is fully-ada compliant by default.
- MVC-Like architecture: The structure of the EasyDocs source means modification is easy. No sifting through a gargled codebase for editing the visuals of a specific template.

## What’s new with 1.0?

EasyDocs 1.0 includes several new features to assist in both the creation and development of documentation:

- Fixed composer installation to check for properly installed extensions and PHP version. I’ve also created an application class for checking things such as PHP extension and folder permission!
- Several design improvements. Animations, sorting, navigation & much more!
- Themes! Developers can now create their own themes which can include customized styles, scripts, templates, and routing file!
- Added a settings pages to add various new tools such as user editing, board privacy settings, and of course the ability to upload and change the application theme.
- Improved layout & integration between the application classes and the usable variables within theme templates. Almost all relevant information inside the application configuration file can be handled within theme templates as easy-to-use array variables.

## Interested in this project?
